      <p class="mb-4">
        A powerful winter storm is moving across Ontario, bringing snowfall ranging from 2 to 35+ cm. 
        Areas north of Highway 407 will experience at least 15 cm with some locations reaching 25 cm. 
        The heaviest totals are expected north of Highway 401, particularly in the Ottawa Valley, where some regions could exceed 35 cm. 
        Precipitation type will depend on the storm's track, with potential mixing near the 401 corridor.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        If the mixing line stays south, particularly near the Niagara, Hamilton, and Brantford areas, 
        snowfall totals in the western GTHA could be significantly higher, with totals potentially exceeding 20 cm due to lake enhancement. 
        However, if the mixing line pushes further north towards the 401 corridor, snowfall totals will be much lower, 
        likely around 10-15 cm, with a greater chance for sleet and freezing rain instead of snow which could decrease totals even more.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Travel will be hazardous during the storm's peak, especially as conditions change along the 401 corridor. 
        Prepare for reduced visibility and icy conditions. Plan accordingly and stay updated on the latest forecasts as the situation evolves.
